```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Homework 2

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)


```

# Challenge 1

```{r}

m <- read_csv("~/movies.csv")
head(m)
```


Use a one-line statement to filter the dataset to include just movies from 1920 to 1979 and movies that are less than 4 hours long (runtimeMinutes < 240), and add a new column that codes the startYear into a new variable, decade (“20s”, “30s”, …“70s”). If you do this correctly, there should be 5741 movies remaining in the dataset.
Use {ggplot2} to plot histograms of the distribution of runtimeMinutes for each decade.

HINT: Try using facet_wrap() to do this!

```{r}

decade <- m %>% filter(startYear >= "1920" & startYear <= "1979")
View(decade)


```
